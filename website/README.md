# The problem

The uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) in countries with large territorial areas is slow, mainly due to the lack of infrastructure to support electric vehicles. In these countries, where long journeys are common, the scarcity of electric car chargers along roads and highways is a major roadblock to their adoption.

Brazil, for example, has a territory of 8.5 million Km², with 1.8 million kilometers of roads and highways. In contrast, China, which leads the world in electric car numbers, has only 160,000 kilometers of roads, eleven times less. Moreover, the government's tepid interest in the subject and the lack of resources further sideline electric cars.

The stigma that "electric cars are only for city driving" doesn't seem to be going anywhere anytime soon. Of the 3,200 EV stations in Brazil, it is estimated that 80% of them are concentrated in the top 10 cities, leaving a mere 640 stations for the rest of the country.

## The scenario

(trazer alguams coisas do problema pra cá e colocar do mercado livre de energia )

## What can we do?

The key to accelerating the adoption of vehicles in these countries lies in the capacity for innovation and action by the private sector. Companies and individuals can significantly boost the charging infrastructure by identifying and investing in strategic locations for charging stations. We should facilitate the entry of players into this market.

Presenting a unified and accessible standard of chargers can lower the entry barrier for setting up new stations, so that points can be created more easily, expanding the charging network and making electric vehicles increasingly accessible.

# The solution

DeVolt is a decentralized platform and protocol designed to facilitate the entry of new players into the electric fueling market. With monetary incentives, logistical facilitations, more accessible stations, and an open, fully transparent market, DeVolt is designed to take electric vehicles further.

# Próximos passos

O mercado da energia secundária entra cada dia mais no foco. Em 2 anos, o mercado de energia estará aberto e legislado no Brasil, têndencia que não tardará em outros países.

**A DeVolt, já com infraestrutura, dados, usuários e know-how, pode tomar a dianteira nesse mercado não só para o abastecimento de veículos, mas principalmente tomando a frente da futura "bolsa de energia"**

A compra e venda de livre energia será um indústria bilionária, e a DeVolt será a intermediadora dessas transações.
