## üìö Technical Vision:
This project was built using Golang as the main language and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) to store the application state, along with the ORM [Gorm](https://gorm.io/). Additionally, this project was built following the [golang-standards](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) [^1], and from an architectural perspective, principles of [hexagonal architecture](https://netflixtechblog.com/ready-for-changes-with-hexagonal-architecture-b315ec967749) [^2] were implemented, such as dependency injection, using the [Wire](https://github.com/google/wire) package for automatic initialization. From a technical standpoint, this choice of architecture and technologies was made possible because we are building this application using the Cartesi infrastructure.

## üèéÔ∏è Running:
### Local node:
- Build the application:

```bash
$ make build
```

- Run locally:

```bash
$ cartesi run
```

### A validator node on Fly.io:
- Build the validator node image
```bash
$ make build
```
- After that, you can follow the [tutorial](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.3/deployment/self-hosted/#hosting-on-flyio) and after creating the necessary infrastructure to host your node, you can use the Docker image generated in the previous step called `validator:latest`

### Application Test:
- To run the complete test suite, run the command below:

```bash
$ make test
```

- To see the test coverage in the application, run the command below:
```bash
$ make coverage
```
